## Intro

How about having a hackathon in a train? 6 hours in a train, without internet, going with the speed over 180 km/h. Sounds crazy, but rather cool, isn't it? Consider high-speed train heading to Berlin with 100+ participants spread over two train wagons. Here at [Parkmobile](https://parkmobile.nl), we like cool things and the spirit of innovation, needless to say I am in!

## Diving deeper

You probably think that hackathon looked like this:

![Drinking beer](./images/beer.jpg)

Yeah right, I wish. The beers will come later. First get you hands dirty:

![Working hard](./images/begin.jpg)

There were 14 teams with 6 participants in each team. A team contains a few software developers (usually 2-3), scientists and 1-2 students (completely non-IT folks). For example, there were two students of Theatre and Performance Studies in my team. There are also people outside of the teams: coaches, mentors and support staff. Time is very limited and you start coding only in the evening of Day 1 (certainly after dinner and a few beers) while pitches start at 2:00 PM on the Day 2. The winning team gets 5, 000 euro gross.

## Lessons learned

_I do hate scrolling down all the way to the bottom of the page to see what really matters. Hence I break the rules and put imprortant stuff right here._

There are a few key points I took from this event. There are actually a lot more of them, but here I list crucial only:  

* [Parkmobile](https://parkmobile.nl) is a great company! Ahaha, now seriously. Having talked to the other participants (huh, competitors!) I clearly see that [Parkmobile](https://parkmobile.nl) invests much more into innovation and technical development of our people. Perhaps because we are part of BMW Group. Or, let's be honest, that's why we are part of BMW Group.

* Acceptance criteria. Ask how jury is going to choose the winner. We were all surprised with the choice. Even the winners...
* Communication. People like to talk and they do talk a lot, a lot more than needed. Absolutely neither listening nor analyzing what others just have said. And they try to make a ~~useless~~ point and then they try to prove their point. And you have to learn how to stop those useless discussions and wasting the time and instead keep the team's focus on the challenge. That is the best you can gain from hackathons
* Time management. Oh how many participants I've seen in panic mode on the Day 2, especially closer to the pitch time. Finally they realize how much time they wasted on nothing. Hackathon is a great excercise that builds discipline
* Teamwork. Don't do the same mistake when you want to sit alone doing **your part**. You will end up with typical problem: your part works pretty well, however whole solution does not work at all.
* Energy and drive. Every team needs someone energetic and proactive. Any team is loosing willingness to win as soon as they encounter issues. Form the team in such a way that you have at least one **energetic doer**. Someone who pushes forward and does not give up.
* Go to the first row if you want nice pictures afterwards. Seriously, those lazy photographers did not bother taking pictures of people further than 1-2 row. Sit in the first row during all events and you become a star :)

## Challenge

The challenge was kept in a secret till the very last moment, before we get into the train.

> You are going to the concert that ends at the late night. Develop the solution by utilizing Mobility-As-A-Service, 3rd party API and Blockchain to help the users to return home in time and according to their preferences.

Solution is not a big deal. The 3rd party API are well specified, we've got the specs from 9292, NS train ad Parkmobile. This covers all the transport and logistics from train and buses to cars and even parking lots. The main problem was a blockchain. What are you going to use it for??

## Solution

## Day 1

We gathered at Amsterdam Central Station at 8:30 AM, had a little breakfast and coffee and meet our teams. A few minutes for  socialization and we are ready to get into the train.

![Getting into train](./images/outtrain.jpg)

Train is full. Berlin, here we come!
![Start](./images/start.jpg)

That was quite warm weather and it was incredibly hot inside the train. We had to change our sweaty T-shirts every now and then.

Finally the team sits together and we begin brainstorming.

At that moment, the main challenge was to stay together and follow the discussion. A lot of people constantly passing nearby were distracting us. And the noise produced by all of us.

And that fluffy unicorn

In a few more hours we were completely exhausted, and (finally) silence came to the stage.

Ho-ho-ho. 100+ geeks in front of Berlin Central Station.

On site. Everybody is looking for a cozy place for the team.

Very late night

Closer to the morning. Only 2 of us and a photographer (obviously)

And we are ready for the pitch. Jury liked our presentation, that's promising

Let the fun begin!

Done. We were close, but nope. We hate the winners, obviously. Nothing personal.

It was great event and a lot of fun. We've gained great experience and made new connections, especially guys from IBM and ING.

Time to go home. Tired but happy!
