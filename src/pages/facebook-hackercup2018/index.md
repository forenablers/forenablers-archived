Curious how good your skills are in problem solving in comparison to others? One of the ways to check is to participate in Facebook Hackercup.

### Why to participate? 

- Compare your skills
- Refresh your CS knowladge
- Train your brain
- Have fun


### What kind of challanges?
The challanges that you will find vary.

### What is a good approach to solve them?

Challange description is huge. It requires some attention to understand it completely. It is needs to be translated into a technical problem and what would be a solution. Train on the challanges from previous years.

It is very helpful to take an example and solve it step by step on paper or on a white board. 

- Allows to see patterns
- Allows to find a simple solution

// TODO: polynomial example

Solve it brute force and improve.

- What are the boundaries of the problem run-time regardless algorithm?
- Check where bottlenecks are and eleminate them
- Are there duplicated work? 
- Are there useless work?

Forget about your CS skills and try to solve this problem as a human or as a small kid. Got a solution? Reverse engineer your thoght process and convert it into an algorithm.

Once the code is written, check it twice. Pay attention to boundary cases. 

- 0 indexed / 1 indexed? 
- +1/-1?
- incorrect input
